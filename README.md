# CPP-3D-Object-Renderer
Trying to expand my knowledge of linear algebra and cpp by making a 3D renderer.
Using SPL2 for window creation and screen drawing.
Repository includes the SPL2 library.

Using as little libraries as possible, so that I can create heuristic data structures and operations for the involved linear algebra.

Will be adding unit tests in future, especially for matrix operations, to ensure accuracy.
